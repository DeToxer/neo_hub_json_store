The idea is that people will get free Neo Candy when participating in events from other N3 projects. Additionally, Neo Candy is a community token, meaning that everyone can participate and receive their free share of Neo Candy. But just holding a token in their wallet with no further use is not very much fun. Therefore, many games are currently under development that let Neo Candy holders spend their candy in a fun way. In addition, some games will also introduce the player to essential DeFi elements.",
